  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Learning about IoT Applicaitons</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Activity 1</h2>
  <p>
    In the first activity we got to know about what an IoT application is and for purpose it
    is used. After some discussion with the team we came to a conclusion that it displays
    the data collected from devices and sensors and statistically organise it. Some of the
    main features of an IoT application are connectivity, analyzing, itnegration, user
    friendly interface. we also looked at some of the IoT application that we use on a daily
    basis. For example, Smart watches, home security, traffic managment, etcetra.

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Activity 2</h2>
  <p>
    In the second activity we discussed about a smart building and thought of various smart
    things that can be used in the building to make it more smart. After the discussion we
    came up with a defination of a smart building, it is a building which uses certain
    resources efficiently, so that the living enviroment of the residents enhances and remains
    safe. It should include automaiton of tasks. Some of the smart building scenarios could
    be Automated air conditioning and heating system, motion controlled lights in specified halls.
  </p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Activity 3</h2>
  <p>
    In the third activity we talked about the control interface of an IoT application also
    discussed about its features and who are the users of the application. We thought of a
    smart parking system with empty slot notification. Its users can be the Staff entering
    the building with their personal vehical, residents of the building, guests, emergency
    service officials. For the components that can be used in this system could be weight
    sensor/pressure plates, amplifier, online database, QR code generator.
